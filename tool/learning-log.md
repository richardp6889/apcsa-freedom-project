* For the first week I started off by watching a playlist detailing the various aspects of swift and learned it is a similar to a mixture between java and javascript where storing data is similar to these. Therefore most of the content from this playlist was easier to understand due unit 1 of this and last year. Apart from this there is syntax native to swift that is self explainable in what it does what you'd think it does.
