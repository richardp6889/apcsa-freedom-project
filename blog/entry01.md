### Swift
Using swift I decided I wanted to make a storage app and that would involve having to get started with xcode the apple IDE. The first things I started watching was [Swift beginer playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwvDm4VfkdpiLvzZFJI6rVIBtdolrJBVB). This teached how to set up variables in the `let nameOfVariable: Type = Respective Data Type` or if `Type` is not specified then it is defaulted to the `Respective Data Type` and cannot be switched afterwards. New data type is Date since that puts the current data and time on the screen. Simply using the `print()` with anything in the paratheses is displayed on the screen. If statements don't require parentheses to run unlike how other languages would require it.

### EDP
When starting with anything I jumped to youtube to see what there was about learning swift and clicking the first thing I saw landed me on the playlist I linked to which is teaching swift in managable bites of code. Watching how something is done before gave me an idea of what I should do when I open a new repository for my project. So the first thing I did was with the new repo was to make variables of different types and trying to put the date. Unfortunately things don't always go to plan which was the case with displaying the date as it gives an error. With the upcoming week I will try and hopefully resovle this issue.

### Skills
#### How to Learn
This skill was needed as swfit operate outside of the cs50 IDE which I had grown accustomed to and. This is also seen in the fact that we are learning a new tool which involves finding useful ways to become more proficient in it.
#### Problem Decomposition
As stated before having to learn a tool involved finding a way to learn it in a way that you can understand which will look different from person to person.
